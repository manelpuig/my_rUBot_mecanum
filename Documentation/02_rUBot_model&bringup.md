# 1. Introduction

The project uses two main packages:

```text

```

The first package contains all robot models.

The second package contains the launch files required to start the different robot configurations in simulation and on real hardware.

Students are not expected to create complete robot descriptions from scratch.

However, they must be able to:

* Understand an existing model.
* Modify an existing model.
* Add new components.
* Verify the resulting system.

# 11. Creating a Gazebo Sim World

Worlds are stored inside:

```text
my_robot_gazebo/worlds
```

Starting point:

```text
empty_world.sdf
```

---

## World Design Rules

To avoid visualization problems:

* Keep the world centered around (0,0)
* Place obstacles symmetrically when possible
* Avoid very large coordinates
* Keep the robot initial position near the origin

## Example Wall

```xml
<model name="wall_1">

  <static>true</static>

  <pose>2 0 0.5 0 0 0</pose>

  <link name="link">

    <collision name="collision">
      <geometry>
        <box>
          <size>4 0.1 1</size>
        </box>
      </geometry>
    </collision>

    <visual name="visual">
      <geometry>
        <box>
          <size>4 0.1 1</size>
        </box>
      </geometry>
    </visual>

  </link>

</model>
```
