# Computer Vision tasks with YOLO

In robot perception, four common vision tasks are typically
used:

-   Image Classification
-   Object Detection
-   Image Segmentation
-   Pose Estimation

These tasks progressively increase spatial understanding of the scene.

## Image Classification

Image classification assigns **one label per image**.

Example:

Input image → `STOP sign`

Used when only the object type matters, not its position.

Typical robotics use: - traffic sign recognition - object category
filtering - simple scene understanding

In our traffic‑sign project we use **classification**, because each
frame contains a single relevant sign.


## Object Detection

Object detection identifies:

-   object class
-   object position
-   bounding box coordinates

Example:

`STOP sign → (x, y, w, h)`

Useful when multiple objects appear simultaneously.

Typical robotics use:

-   obstacle detection
-   people detection
-   multi‑sign navigation


Detection could be added later to our project using datasets annotated
with tools such as **Roboflow**.


## Image Segmentation

Segmentation assigns a **class label to each pixel** in the image.

Instead of bounding boxes, it produces masks.

Typical robotics use:

-   road detection
-   hand contour extraction
-   grasp planning
-   environment mapping


Segmentation provides higher spatial precision but requires more
computation.

## Pose Estimation

Pose estimation detects **keypoints of articulated bodies**, typically
humans.

Example:

-   shoulders
-   elbows
-   wrists
-   knees

Typical robotics use:

-   gesture recognition
-   human‑robot interaction
-   hand tracking
-   collaborative robotics


Pose estimation is useful for interaction tasks such as detecting a
handshake or a raised hand.

## YOLO

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a family of real-time object detection models based on deep learning.

We use Yolo because:

-   it runs in real time
-   it works well on CPU systems
-   it supports classification, detection, segmentation and pose
    estimation
-   it integrates easily with ROS 2 pipelines

Alternative frameworks exist:

-   Detectron2
-   Faster R‑CNN
-   EfficientDet
-   RT‑DETR

However, YOLO provides the best balance between speed, simplicity, and
accuracy for robotics education.

## Ultralytics

Ultralytics is a Python library for training and running YOLO-based computer vision models.

We use **Ultralytics Python library** because it:

-   simplifies training workflows
-   supports custom datasets
-   exports `.pt` models easily
-   runs efficiently on embedded platforms
-   integrates well with real‑time camera pipelines

## Current Strategy in the Traffic Sign Project

Current approach:

Traffic signs → **classification model**

Advantages:

-   simple dataset structure
-   fast training
-   efficient inference on mobile robots

Future extension:

Traffic signs → **object detection model**

This can be implemented by labeling bounding boxes using **Roboflow**
and retraining YOLO in detection mode.

This upgrade allows the robot to detect multiple signs simultaneously
inside the same image.

## Objectives 

The signals that we want to identify are:
- Stop
- Turn Right

- Give Way
- No Entry

## Installation
````bash
py -3.11 -m pip install ultralytics
py -3.11 -m pip uninstall numpy
py -3.11 -m pip install "numpy<2.0"
py -3.11 -m pip install pillow
py -3.11 -m pip install opencv-python

## **1. YOLO Model generation for Classification task**

For Traffic signs classification we will use the YOLO11 model, that is a pre-trained model.
- You need an initial structure:
````python
photos/
├── Stop/
├── Right/
├── Left/
├── Give/
├── Nothing/
└── Forbidden/
````
- Now you have to make photos (around 200) for each traffic sign with different positions, ilumination, environment, etc
    - If you want to use your computer webcam: 
        - open terminal in `/photos/Stop` folder, for exemple and
        - run `1_capture_images.py`
    - If you want to use the rUBot camera: 
        - Create a ROS2 node to read Images from `/image_raw` topic and save in speciffic folder (1_capture_images_from_topic.py)
        - In a new terminal execute:
        ````bash
        py -3.11 1_capture_images_from_topic.py
        ````
        - verify the topic name and change OUTPUT_RELATIVE_PATH for each signal
- First step is to resize to a 640x640 file format in a new structure, with the code `2_prepare_dataset.py`:
````python
traffic_sign_dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── Stop/
│   ├── Right/
│   ├── Left/
│   ├── Give/
│   ├── Nothing/
│   └── Forbidden/
└── val/
    ├── Stop/
    ├── Right/
    ├── Left/
    ├── Give/
    ├── Nothing/
    └── Forbidden/
````
> See the value: TRAIN_RATIO = 0.80   # 80% train, 20% val
- Train a classification model with `3_generate_model.py`
- the model will be generated in: `runs/classify/train/weights/best.pt`
- **To test the model prediction** with the classification model `best.pt`:
    - Using your computer webcam:
        - Verify on `4_classify_camera.py` python code MODEL_PATH and execute it
    - If you want to use the rUBot camera: 
        - Create a ROS2 node to read Images from `/image_raw` topic and classify in real-time using the previously generated model (4_classify_camera_from_topic.py)
        - In a new terminal execute:
        ````bash
        py -3.11 4_classify_camera_from_topic.py
        ````
        - verify the topic name and MODEL_PATH
